This is the reason why we can at the same time have a browser, mail client and torrent client open for example. This layer will assign each of these applications a session so that the data can be managed accordingly. </p>"},{"location":"internet-models.html#layer-4-transport-layer-segmentation-and-reassembly","title":"Layer 4: Transport Layer - Segmentation and Reassembly","text":"<p>Unlike the name would suggest, transport layer does not transport data between different devices. Transport layer's job is to break down data from the upper layers into digestible chunks and to append header with source and destination [[PORTS|port]] so that the machines on a network know which service said data chunks are meant for.</p> <ul> <li>Source port is required on the source machine in cases where we have multiple applications using the same protocol. If, for example, we had multiple browsers installed, when we try to access a website on one through HTTP, we do not want the result to be opened in another browser. Source port will be a random number between 1024-65535.</li> <li>Destination port will depend on which service we require from the destination machine, and will be provided by the application layer. It will most commonly be one of the well known ports (1-1024).</li> </ul> <p>This process is called segmentation, and said chunks are called segments or datagrams.</p> <p>The receiving system then does the reassembly of these segments - recognizes the incoming packets as one data transmission, reassembles the packets correctly based on the information included in the packets by the sending system and verifies that all the packets for that piece of data arrived in good shape.\u00a0</p> <p>The primary functions of the Transport Layer are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To enable efficient network transmission, the Transport Layer splits the total amount of data it gets from the applications running at the top layers into smaller units known as segments. The Transport Layer puts these bits back together into the original data stream at the other end.</p> </li> <li> <p>In situations when organised data transfer is required, the Transport Layer creates a connection between the source and the destination. In order to create the proper parameters and guarantee that both systems are prepared to communicate data, a handshake protocol is established. When the data transfer is complete, the Transport Layer closes the connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>The transport layer also assures dependable data transmission. Receiving acknowledgments, or ACK bits, is how this is accomplished. While waiting for the recipient to acknowledge the parts it sent, the sender keeps an eye on them. Any damaged segments are retransmitted by the sender if they receive an acknowledgment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flow regulation - In order to prevent data overload, transport layer regulates the data transfer rate. </p> </li> <li> <p>Both error detection and repair are handled by the transport layer. Checksums are one of these techniques for error detection. By computing and validating checksums, it can ascertain whether data was tampered with during transmission. The Transport Layer will request retransmission if it finds anything.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Depending on whether the connection favors performance or stability, we differentiate two transport layer protocols: - [[TCP vs UDP]]</p>"},{"location":"internet-models.html#layer-3-network-layer","title":"Layer 3: Network Layer","text":"<p>Because these segments will need to travel all over the Internet along different pathways, we need a mechanism that knows once the segment does arrive, which pathway it's supposed to be sent down to so that it all gets to the final destination.

It adds NIC\u2019s MAC address and attaches MAC addresses to the frame, adds and checks the FCS and ensures that frames are sent along the network cabling.\u00a0</p> <p>A frame will consist of a header and a trailer attached to it.

Most common type is the UTP cable (unshielded twisted pair) which can transmit and receive data, as well as a central box (Hub/Switch) that handles a flow from one machine to another. Each system on a network has a cable connected to the central box.</p> <p>Network Interface Card (NIC) serves as the interface between the PC and the network. Each NIC has a unique identifier with a 48-bit value called media access control address (MAC address) so data is transferred to the right system. No two NICs ever share the same MAC address. Those numbers are provided by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to the companies making NICs, which often print the numbers onto the device itself using hexadecimal notation.  - Example: 00\u201340\u201305\u201360\u20137D\u201349</p> <p>First six digits in MAC address represent the number of the NIC manufacturer and they are referred to as Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) while the last six digits represent the unique serial number for the NIC and are referred to as device ID. Nomenclature for MAC addresses is also known as MAC-48 and EUI-48 (Extended Unique Identifier, chosen for trademarking purposes).\u00a0</p> <p>NICs transfer the information through the UTP cable in the form of binary data that is broken down into discrete chunks called frames. The NICs create and send, as well as receive and read these frames. Different frames are used on different networks and all NICs on the same network must use the same frame type to communicate with other NICs.</p> <p>(Optional)     Frame begins with the MAC address of the NIC to which the data is to be sent, followed by the MAC address of the sending NIC. Next comes the Types\u00a0field which indicates the type of data transferred, followed by the Data field which contains the encapsulated information. Lastly, there is a special bit of checking information called frame check sequence. FCS uses a type of binary math called cyclic redundancy check (CRC) in order to verify that the data has arrived intact. Most wired connections hold up to 1500 bytes of data.\u00a0</p> <p>When a system sends a frame out on the network, the frame goes into the central box. What happens from that point depends on the type of central box. - Hub could make a copy of the frame and send it to all the connected ports except for the port from which the message originated. Only the NIC to which the frame was addressed would process that frame and the others would drop it when they saw it wasn\u2019t addressed to their MAC addresses. - Switch sent a frame only to the interface associated with the destination of the MAC address.</p> <p>(Optional)     In situations where NIC doesn\u2019t know the MAC address of another NIC, they send a broadcast onto the network to ask for it. If a NIC sends a frame using a broadcast address (MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF), that frame is processed by every single NIC on that network. That broadcast frame\u2019s data will contain a request for a system\u2019s MAC address. Without knowing the MAC address to begin with, the requesting computer will use an IP address to pick the target computer out of the crowd. The system that is sought will read the request in the broadcast frame and respond its MAC address.</p> <p>When the frame finally arrives to the destination machine, the entire process will be reversed. - Data Link will remove the header and a trailer from the frame and pass the packet along to the Network layer. - Network layer will remove the header and pass the packet to the Transport layer. - Transport layer will read the destination port and transfer the frame to the appropriate service in the upper layers.</p> <p>PDU - protocol data unit</p>"},{"location":"internet-models.html#tcpip-model","title":"TCP/IP model","text":"<p>The reason why TCP/IP model has this name is because the persons who developed it focused primarily on these two protocols.
