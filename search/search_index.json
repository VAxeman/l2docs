Most common client is  FileZilla that supports FTP, FTPS and SFTP, but web browsers can also serve as FTP clients. There are several different ways an FTP server and client software can conduct a file transfer using FTP:</p> <ul> <li>Anonymous FTP.\u00a0This is the most basic form of FTP. It provides support for data transfers without encrypting data or using a username and password. It's most commonly used for download of material that is allowed for unrestricted distribution. </li> <li>Password-protected FTP.\u00a0This is also a basic FTP service, but it requires the use of a username and password, though the service might not be encrypted or secure. It also works on port 21.</li> <li>FTP Secure (FTPS) is an extension of FTP that adds security through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. It provides an additional layer of protection by encrypting the control and data connections, preventing unauthorized access and data interception. FTPS can use either implicit SSL/TLS (FTPIS) or explicit SSL/TLS (FTPS). Implicit FTPS requires SSL/TLS encryption from the start, while explicit FTPS allows the client and server to negotiate encryption after the initial connection. It typically defaults to using port 990.</li> <li>Secure FTP (SFTP) - This is technically not an FTP protocol, but it functions similarly. Rather, SFTP is a subset of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol that runs over port 22. SSH is commonly used by systems administrators to remotely and securely access systems and applications, and SFTP provides a mechanism within SSH for secure file transfer.</li> </ul> <p>By default, FTP does not encrypt traffic, and individuals can capture packets to read usernames, passwords and other data.

It is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages. The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called\u00a0requests\u00a0and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called\u00a0responses.</p> <p>To display a Web page, the browser sends an original request to fetch the HTML document that represents the webpage. A server will accept the request and access port 80 which is reserved for HTTP requests and serve the file to the user-agent. The Web browser then combines these resources to present the complete document, the Web page. Scripts executed by the browser can fetch more resources in later phases and the browser updates the Web page accordingly.</p> <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol:</p> <p>HTTP that is the actual transport protocol between the server and the client -- is \"stateless\" because it remembers nothing between invocations.\u00a0EVERY\u00a0resource that is accessed via HTTP is a single request with no threaded connection between them. If you load a web page with an HTML file that within it contains three\u00a0<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>\u00a0tags hitting the same server, there will be four TCP connections negotiated and opened, four data transfers, four connections closed. There is simply no state kept at the server\u00a0at the\u00a0protocol\u00a0level\u00a0that will have the server know anything about you as you come in.</p> <p>Almost anything you want to do other than viewing static web pages will involve sessions and states. When HTTP is used for its original purpose (sharing static information like scientific papers) the stateless protocol makes a lot of sense. When you start using it for things like web applications, online stores, etc. then statelessness starts to be a bother because these are inherently stateful activities. As a result people very rapidly came up with ways to slather state on top of the stateless protocol. These mechanisms have included things like cookies, like encoding state in the URLs and having the server dynamically fire up data based on those, like hidden state requests</p>"},{"location":"HTTP-HTTPS.html#https-hypertext-transfer-protocol-secure","title":"HTTPS - hypertext transfer protocol secure.","text":"<p>The issue with HTTP is that it does not encrypt the packages when a client is communicating with the server.

Most common type is the UTP cable (unshielded twisted pair) which can transmit and receive data, as well as a central box (Hub/Switch) that handles a flow from one machine to another. Each system on a network has a cable connected to the central box.</p> <p>Network Interface Card (NIC) serves as the interface between the PC and the network. Each NIC has a unique identifier with a 48-bit value called media access control address (MAC address) so data is transferred to the right system. No two NICs ever share the same MAC address. Those numbers are provided by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to the companies making NICs, which often print the numbers onto the device itself using hexadecimal notation.  - Example: 00\u201340\u201305\u201360\u20137D\u201349</p> <p>First six digits in MAC address represent the number of the NIC manufacturer and they are referred to as Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) while the last six digits represent the unique serial number for the NIC and are referred to as device ID. Nomenclature for MAC addresses is also known as MAC-48 and EUI-48 (Extended Unique Identifier, chosen for trademarking purposes).\u00a0</p> <p>NICs transfer the information through the UTP cable in the form of binary data that is broken down into discrete chunks called frames. The NICs create and send, as well as receive and read these frames. Different frames are used on different networks and all NICs on the same network must use the same frame type to communicate with other NICs.</p> <p>(Optional)     Frame begins with the MAC address of the NIC to which the data is to be sent, followed by the MAC address of the sending NIC. Next comes the Types\u00a0field which indicates the type of data transferred, followed by the Data field which contains the encapsulated information. Lastly, there is a special bit of checking information called frame check sequence. FCS uses a type of binary math called cyclic redundancy check (CRC) in order to verify that the data has arrived intact. Most wired connections hold up to 1500 bytes of data.\u00a0</p> <p>When a system sends a frame out on the network, the frame goes into the central box. What happens from that point depends on the type of central box. - Hub could make a copy of the frame and send it to all the connected ports except for the port from which the message originated. Only the NIC to which the frame was addressed would process that frame and the others would drop it when they saw it wasn\u2019t addressed to their MAC addresses. - Switch sent a frame only to the interface associated with the destination of the MAC address.</p> <p>(Optional)     In situations where NIC doesn\u2019t know the MAC address of another NIC, they send a broadcast onto the network to ask for it. If a NIC sends a frame using a broadcast address (MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF), that frame is processed by every single NIC on that network. That broadcast frame\u2019s data will contain a request for a system\u2019s MAC address. Without knowing the MAC address to begin with, the requesting computer will use an IP address to pick the target computer out of the crowd. The system that is sought will read the request in the broadcast frame and respond its MAC address.</p> <p>When the frame finally arrives to the destination machine, the entire process will be reversed. - Data Link will remove the header and a trailer from the frame and pass the packet along to the Network layer. - Network layer will remove the header and pass the packet to the Transport layer. - Transport layer will read the destination port and transfer the frame to the appropriate service in the upper layers.</p> <p>PDU - protocol data unit</p>"},{"location":"internet-models.html#tcpip-model","title":"TCP/IP model","text":"<p>The reason why TCP/IP model has this name is because the persons who developed it focused primarily on these two protocols.

Information that CSR includes is:</p> <ul> <li>Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)</li> <li>Legal name of the organization</li> <li>Division of the Organization</li> <li>City</li> <li>Region</li> <li>Country</li> <li>Email address</li> </ul> <p>Once a CSR is created, an SSL certificate can then be purchased from the CA. A CA is an outside organization, a trusted third party, that generates and gives out SSL certificates. Once the certificate is issued, it needs to be installed and activated on the website's origin server and when it's activated on the origin server, the website will be able to load over HTTPS and all traffic to and from the website will be encrypted and secure.</p> <p>SSL certificates include the following information in a single data file:</p> <ul> <li>The\u00a0domain name that the certificate was issued for</li> <li>Which person, organization, or device it was issued to</li> <li>Which certificate authority issued it</li> <li>The certificate authority's digital signature</li> <li>Associated subdomains</li> <li>Issue date of the certificate</li> <li>Expiration date of the certificate</li> <li>The public key (the private key is kept secret)</li> </ul> <p>The public and private keys used for SSL are essentially long strings of characters used for encrypting and signing data. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key during the process known as an SSL handshake:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Step 1: The SSL/TLS client will send the server a \u201cClientHello\u201d message that includes information about the browser, the OS, SSL/TLS version and the encryption algorithm that the client supports.</p> </li> <li> <p>Step 2: The SSL/TLS server sends back a \u201cServerHello\u201d message with an agreement on which encryption algorithm they should use during the session, it's digital certificate containing the domain name and certificate authority, and the public key they would use for encryption.</p> </li> <li> <p>Step 3: The client then confirms that the web server\u2019s digital certificate is valid and issued by a CA. </p> <p>Technically, anyone can create their own SSL certificate by generating a public-private key pairing and including all the information mentioned above. Such certificates are called self-signed certificates because the digital signature used, instead of being from a CA, would be the website's own private key.</p> <p>But with self-signed certificates, there's no outside authority to verify that the origin server is who it claims to be. Browsers don't consider self-signed certificates trustworthy and may still mark sites with one as \"not secure,\" despite the https:// URL. They may also terminate the connection altogether, blocking the website from loading.</p> </li> <li> <p>Step 4: If the certificate is valid, client extracts the public key and generates a new key for that particular session, then encrypts the session key with the public key and sends it back to the server.</p> </li> <li>Step 5: The SSL/TLS server decrypts the session key using its private key.</li> <li>Step 6: Both the client and the server now use the session key to communicate.</li> <li>Step 7: Finally, both the server and the client now exchange the finished messages using the new session key.
