Most common client is  FileZilla that supports FTP, FTPS and SFTP, but web browsers can also serve as FTP clients. There are several different ways an FTP server and client software can conduct a file transfer using FTP:</p> <ul> <li>Anonymous FTP.\u00a0This is the most basic form of FTP. It provides support for data transfers without encrypting data or using a username and password. It's most commonly used for download of material that is allowed for unrestricted distribution. </li> <li>Password-protected FTP.\u00a0This is also a basic FTP service, but it requires the use of a username and password, though the service might not be encrypted or secure. It also works on port 21.</li> <li>FTP Secure (FTPS) is an extension of FTP that adds security through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. It provides an additional layer of protection by encrypting the control and data connections, preventing unauthorized access and data interception. FTPS can use either implicit SSL/TLS (FTPIS) or explicit SSL/TLS (FTPS). Implicit FTPS requires SSL/TLS encryption from the start, while explicit FTPS allows the client and server to negotiate encryption after the initial connection. It typically defaults to using port 990.</li> <li>Secure FTP (SFTP) - This is technically not an FTP protocol, but it functions similarly. Rather, SFTP is a subset of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol that runs over port 22. SSH is commonly used by systems administrators to remotely and securely access systems and applications, and SFTP provides a mechanism within SSH for secure file transfer.</li> </ul> <p>By default, FTP does not encrypt traffic, and individuals can capture packets to read usernames, passwords and other data.

It is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages. The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called\u00a0requests\u00a0and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called\u00a0responses.</p> <p>To display a Web page, the browser sends an original request to fetch the HTML document that represents the webpage. A server will accept the request and access port 80 which is reserved for HTTP requests and serve the file to the user-agent. The Web browser then combines these resources to present the complete document, the Web page. Scripts executed by the browser can fetch more resources in later phases and the browser updates the Web page accordingly.</p> <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol:</p> <p>HTTP that is the actual transport protocol between the server and the client -- is \"stateless\" because it remembers nothing between invocations.\u00a0EVERY\u00a0resource that is accessed via HTTP is a single request with no threaded connection between them. If you load a web page with an HTML file that within it contains three\u00a0<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>\u00a0tags hitting the same server, there will be four TCP connections negotiated and opened, four data transfers, four connections closed.

When HTTP is used for its original purpose (sharing static information like scientific papers) the stateless protocol makes a lot of sense. When you start using it for things like web applications, online stores, etc. then statelessness starts to be a bother because these are inherently stateful activities. As a result people very rapidly came up with ways to slather state on top of the stateless protocol. These mechanisms have included things like cookies, like encoding state in the URLs and having the server dynamically fire up data based on those, like hidden state requests</p>"},{"location":"HTTP-HTTPS.html#https-hypertext-transfer-protocol-secure","title":"HTTPS - hypertext transfer protocol secure.","text":"<p>The issue with HTTP is that it does not encrypt the packages when a client is communicating with the server.

Each has its own characteristics and security mechanisms, including specific log locations for recording various activities and events. 1.1 FTP Purpose FTP is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server. It is a relatively old protocol and does not provide encryption, making it less secure for transferring sensitive data. 1.2 FTPS Purpose FTPS is an extension of FTP that adds security through encryption. It uses SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt data in transit, making it more secure than plain FTP. 1.3 SFTP Purpose SFTP is a secure file transfer protocol that operates over an encrypted SSH (Secure Shell) connection. It provides strong authentication and encryption, making it one of the most secure methods for transferring files. Bonus (question they like to ask): Difference between FTPS and SFTP Both FTPS and SFTP are protocols used for transferring files securely. However: FTPS uses certain secure protocols to encrypt data (SSL/TLS), while SFTP works through an encrypted SSH connection. SFTP works well with firewalls, but its binary data transmissions are not suitable for logging. FTPS file transmissions are significantly faster than SFTP. They have different authentication methods (encrypted key pairs) and the list of commands is different. 2.

They are not routable on the public Internet and are meant for internal use only.</p> <p>Public: Public IP addresses are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and are globally routable on the public Internet. They are unique across the entire Internet. Public IP address ranges are not specifically designated by classes as in the past, but IP address blocks are allocated to organizations by regional Internet registries. Ping Purpose: The \u2018ping\u2019 command is a network utility used to test the reachability of a host (usually identified by its IP address or domain name) on a network and measure the round-trip time for data to travel from the source to the destination and back. It is a fundamental tool for diagnosing network connectivity issues and assessing network performance. Basic syntax: $ ping [options] host_or_ip_address Options (flags): -c count: Specify the number of ICMP echo request packets to send (default is infinite). -i interval: Set the interval between sending packets (default is 1 second). -t timeout: Define the maximum time to wait for a response (default is network-dependent). -q: Quiet mode; only display summary information. -v: Verbose mode; display detailed information about each packet. Reading the output: The first thing we see is the server\u2019s host name. This will confirm you have an active connection to the server.  Next are the number of bytes being sent to the server, which will typically show 32.  The next four lines indicate the response time from the server. You\u2019ll see how many bytes of data were sent back, as well as how many milliseconds the response took to return.  TTL means \u201ctime to live.\u201d This information shows you the total routers the packet will travel through before stopping.  If you see \u201crequest timed out,\u201d it tells you that the packets couldn\u2019t find the host, which indicates a connection problem. The Ping statistics section shows the overall numbers for the process. The packets line shows the number of packets sent and received, and tells you if any were lost. If they were, there\u2019s like a connection issue. Lastly, approximate round trip times show the connection speed. The higher the time, the worse the connection. 2.1 Ping Example Command $ ping -c 5 cloudhost-3907436.us-midwest-1.nxcli.net PING cloudhost-3907436.us-midwest-1.nxcli.net (8.29.157.141) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from cloudhost-3907436.us-midwest-1.nxcli.net (8.29.157.141): icmp_seq=1 ttl=59 time=0.403 ms 64 bytes from cloudhost-3907436.us-midwest-1.nxcli.net (8.29.157.141): icmp_seq=2 ttl=59 time=0.335 ms 64 bytes from cloudhost-3907436.us-midwest-1.nxcli.net (8.29.157.141): icmp_seq=3 ttl=59 time=0.550 ms 64 bytes from cloudhost-3907436.us-midwest-1.nxcli.net (8.29.157.141): icmp_seq=4 ttl=59 time=0.427 ms 64 bytes from cloudhost-3907436.us-midwest-1.nxcli.net (8.29.157.141): icmp_seq=5 ttl=59 time=0.299 ms --- cloudhost-3907436.us-midwest-1.nxcli.net ping statistics --- 5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 5010ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.299/0.402/0.550/0.090 ms Traceroute The command use: The <code>traceroute</code> command is a network diagnostic tool used to trace and display the route that data packets take from a source computer or device to a destination host or IP address on a network. It provides a detailed list of all the intermediary routers or network devices (hops) that the data packets pass through on their journey to the destination. This information is helpful for diagnosing network routing issues, identifying latency bottlenecks, and understanding the network path between two points. An Internet Protocol (IP) tracer is helpful for figuring out the routing hops data has to go through, as well as response delays as it travels across nodes, which are what send the data toward its destination. Traceroute also enables you to locate where the data was unable to be sent along, known as points of failure. You can also perform a visual traceroute to get a visual representation of each hop. Reading the information from <code>traceroute</code> command: Hops and Round Trip Times (RTT) The traceroute report lists data pertaining to every router the packets pass through as they head to their destination. The hops get numbered on the left side of the report window. Each line in the report has the domain name\u2014if that was included\u2014as well as the IP address belonging to the router. There are also three measurements of time, displayed in milliseconds. These tell you the length of time to send the ICMP packets from your computer to that router and back. Typical Hop Sequence A \u201chop\u201d refers to the move data makes as it goes from one router to the next. The first hop within the report provides information about the first router, which would be on your local-area network (LAN). The hops that come after provide data about routers controlled by your internet service provider (ISP). When the ICMP packets get beyond the ISP\u2019s domain, they go to the general internet, and you will likely see that the hop times increase, typically due to geographical distance. If there is an asterisk Sometimes, a traceroute has a hard time accessing a device or is unreachable. In these situations, it may show a message saying, \u201cRequest timed out,\u201d along with an asterisk. This indicates that the router it reached was configured to deprioritize or automatically reject ICMP packets, which is done because ICMP is not categorized as essential traffic by many routers. If you get several timeouts in a row, it can be because: The packets arrived at a router with a firewall that prevents traceroute online requests. The packets arrived at the subsequent router, but they were not able to return to the computer that sent them. The router has a connection problem. <code>traceroute</code> vs <code>ping</code>: While ping is excellent for basic reachability testing and measuring round-trip times to a specific host or IP address, traceroute provides a more comprehensive view of the network's behavior, making it particularly valuable for diagnosing routing issues, network performance problems, and complex network topologies. Traceroute is specifically designed to help identify routing issues within a network. If you suspect that there are problems with the routing of packets to a destination, such as traffic being routed through an unexpected path or delays at specific router hops, traceroute is the tool of choice. It provides a detailed view of the network path, including all the intermediate routers. Comparison: Purpose: ping is primarily used to check reachability and measure RTT, while traceroute is used to trace the network path and identify routing issues. Output: ping provides simple reachability and latency information, while traceroute provides detailed information about each hop along the route. Use Cases: Use ping for basic reachability and latency testing. Use traceroute when you need to diagnose complex network problems, understand the network path, or identify routing issues. 3.1 Traceroute Command Example $ traceroute cloudhost-3907436.us-midwest-1.nxcli.net traceroute to cloudhost-3907436.us-midwest-1.nxcli.net (8.29.157.141), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets  1  nx-mel-vlan20.dx1b.nexcess.net (208.69.120.1)  42.723 ms  42.580 ms  42.433 ms  2  xldx1b.core-1.mel.dtw.nexcess.net (192.240.191.186)  0.421 ms  0.284 ms  0.196 ms  3  xlcore1.dx.1d.mel-01.dtw.nexcess.net (192.240.191.191)  15.007 ms  26.214 ms  14.747 ms  4  * * *  5  * * *  6  cloudhost-3907436.us-midwest-1.nxcli.net (8.29.157.141)  0.372 ms  0.373 ms  0.321 ms</p> <p>Firewall - APF vs iptables APF (Advanced Policy Firewall) and iptables are related but distinct components in the context of firewall management on Linux systems. iptables: iptables is a Command-Line Utility: iptables is a command-line utility for configuring the packet filter rules in the Linux kernel's netfilter framework. It is a part of the Linux kernel and is the standard tool for managing packet filtering rules. APF (Advanced Policy Firewall) Nexcess uses this: APF is wrapper/simplifier of Iptables, not a stand-alone firewall Firewall Management Script: APF (Advanced Policy Firewall) is a script that sits on top of iptables and provides a higher-level interface for managing firewall rules. It simplifies the process of configuring iptables rules by offering a more user-friendly interface. Rule Management: APF allows you to manage rules using configuration files, and it includes pre-configured rule sets for common services and applications. Event-Based System: APF includes an event-based system that can trigger actions based on various events, such as excessive connections or port scans. This can enhance security by automatically responding to specific network activities. Comparison: Abstraction Level: iptables provides a lower-level, direct interface to the Linux kernel's netfilter framework. APF is a higher-level tool that simplifies the creation and management of iptables rules. Use Cases: iptables is suitable for advanced users who require fine-grained control over packet filtering. APF is often used by administrators who prioritize ease of use and may not need the full range of capabilities offered by iptables.</p> <p>Linux ownership &amp; permissions Ownership ownership refers to the user and group associated with a file or directory and what permissions they have. Every file and directory on a Linux system has an owner and a group. These ownership settings determine who can access and modify the file or directory</p> <p>Changing user ownership: Chown newowner:groupname filename</p> <p>Changing group ownership: Chown :newgroup filename Permissions Digit combination permission- adding permission via values to desired category User (Owner): The user who owns the file. This user has specific permissions on the file. Group: A collection of users. The group ownership allows multiple users to share access to a file. Users who are members of the group associated with a file can have specific permissions. Others: All other users on the system who are not the owner or members of the group. This category includes the rest of the world. Read4 Write2 eXecute1</p> <p>What is 523 permission? r _ x . _ w _ . _ w x</p> <p>let's break down a 3-digit octal permission like 523: The first digit (5) represents the user's (owner's) permissions. 5 in octal is equivalent to 101 in binary, which means: The user has read (4) and execute (1) permissions, but not write (2) permissions. The second digit (2) represents the group's permissions. 2 in octal is equivalent to 010 in binary, which means: The group has write (2) permissions but not read (4) or execute (1) permissions. The third digit (3) represents others' permissions. 3 in octal is equivalent to 011 in binary, which means: Others have read (4) and write (2) permissions but not execute (1) permissions.</p> <p>So, in the context of file or directory permissions, \"523\" would represent the following: The user (owner) has read and execute permissions (5). The group has write permissions (2). Others have read and write permissions (3).</p> <p>PERMISSIONS:</p> <p>Linux file permissions are represented using a 3-digit octal (base-8) number, where each digit corresponds to a specific permission category: user (owner), group, and others. These numbers are used to specify who can perform certain actions on a file or directory. Each digit is a combination of three bits (0 to 7) representing read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions.</p> <p>Here's how the permissions are represented: Read (r) permission is represented by 4. Write (w) permission is represented by 2. Execute (x) permission is represented by 1.</p> <p>You can calculate the permission value for each category (user, group, others) by adding up the values for the respective permissions. For example: If a user has read (r) and write (w) permissions but no execute (x) permission, their permission value is 4 (read) + 2 (write) + 0 (no execute) = 6. If a group has only read (r) permission, its permission value is 4 (read) + 0 (no write) + 0 (no execute) = 4. If others have only execute (x) permission, their permission value is 0 (no read) + 0 (no write) + 1 (execute) = 1.</p> <p>Keep in mind that there are also special permissions like the setuid (s), setgid (s), and sticky bit (t), which can modify the standard permission behavior, but they are not represented in the the 3-digit octal notation. These special permissions are indicated by additional characters when viewing permissions with the ls command (e.g., -rwsr-xr-x).</p> <p>How do we change permissions?

Ownership determines who has control over a file or directory and what permissions they have. There are two primary components of ownership: the user owner and the group owner.</p> <p>User Owner: The user owner is the individual user who has control over the file or directory. This user can perform various actions on the file, depending on the permissions set.</p> <p>Group Owner: The group owner is a group of users who also have certain permissions on the file or directory. These permissions are separate from those of the user owner and allow multiple users to collaborate on files while maintaining certain security restrictions.</p> <p>How do we change ownership? Command examples / different ways:</p> <p>Here are some common commands and concepts related to Linux ownership:</p> <p>ls -l: Use the ls command with the -l option to list files and directories in long format, which includes ownership information. The output will display the user owner, group owner, and permissions. Example:</p> <p>$ ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 user1 group1 1024 Oct 10 12:34 file.txt</p> <p>chown: The chown command is used to change the owner of a file or directory. You need superuser (root) privileges to change ownership to a different user. Example:</p> <p>sudo chown newowner:groupname file.txt</p> <p>chgrp: The chgrp command is used to change the group ownership of a file or directory. Like chown, you typically need superuser privileges to change the group. Example:</p> <p>sudo chgrp newgroup file.txt</p> <p>groups: The groups command displays the groups a user belongs to. Example:</p> <p>groups username</p> <p>useradd: The useradd command is used to create a new user on the system. Example:</p> <p>sudo useradd newuser</p> <p>groupadd: The groupadd command creates a new group on the system. Example:</p> <p>sudo groupadd newgroup</p> <p>It's essential to manage ownership and permissions carefully, especially for sensitive system files and directories, to maintain system security and proper access control.

This is crucial for securing online transactions, protecting sensitive information, and establishing trust between users and websites Encryption: SSL/TLS encrypts the data exchanged between the client and the server. This encryption ensures that even if the transmitted data is intercepted by unauthorized entities, it cannot be easily read or understood. Data Integrity: SSL/TLS provides mechanisms to verify the integrity of the transmitted data. This ensures that the data has not been tampered with during transit. Authentication: SSL/TLS facilitates mutual authentication between the client and the server. This ensures that both parties can verify each other's identities. In the case of websites, SSL/TLS allows users to verify that they are connected to the legitimate website and not a malicious impostor. Compliance with Regulations: Many data protection regulations and standards, such as GDPR, require the use of encryption to protect sensitive information. SSL/TLS helps organizations comply with these regulations.</p> <p>Signed vs Self-Signed The difference between signed SSL/TLS certificates and self-signed SSL/TLS certificates: Signed SSL/TLS Certificates: Certificate Authority (CA): These certificates are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) that are widely recognized and accepted by web browsers and other client applications. Trust: Web browsers and client applications inherently trust SSL/TLS certificates signed by well-known CAs. When a user connects to a website with a signed certificate, the browser doesn't display security warnings (assuming no issues with the certificate). Cost: Obtaining a signed certificate from a trusted CA typically involves a cost, as CAs need to validate the domain ownership before issuing the certificate. Self-Signed SSL/TLS Certificates: Certificate Issued by the Entity: Self-signed certificates are generated and signed by the entity that owns the server (e.g., the website administrator) rather than a third-party CA. Trust: Self-signed certificates are not automatically trusted by web browsers and client applications. When a user connects to a website using a self-signed certificate, the browser typically displays a warning about the potential security risk. Cost: Self-signed certificates are free to create and use, making them a cost-effective option. Use Cases: Signed Certificates: These are suitable for public-facing websites and applications where user trust and security are critical. They are essential for e-commerce websites, online banking, and any site or service handling sensitive user data. Self-Signed Certificates: Self-signed certificates are commonly used for internal services, testing environments, or in situations where the audience connecting to the server is controlled and can be informed about the use of self-signed certificates. They are not recommended for public-facing websites or applications, as they can lead to a poor user experience due to security warnings. SSL/TLS certificates are essential for securing data transmission on the internet. While signed certificates are trusted and widely used for public-facing websites, self-signed certificates have their place in controlled environments or for internal use. However, it's crucial to be aware of the limitations and potential security warnings associated with self-signed certificates. In summary, the key distinction is that signed certificates are issued by a trusted third-party CA, while self-signed certificates are generated and signed by the entity itself. The choice between them depends on the level of trust required for your specific use case and whether the certificate is intended for public or internal use.</p>"},{"location":"deliverability.html","title":"SPF/DKIM/DMARC EXPLAINED:","text":"<p>SPF, DKIM, and DMARC: The Three Musketeers of Email Authentication</p> <p>In the world of email security, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are three essential protocols that help prevent spam and phishing attacks by verifying the authenticity of email messages.</p> <p>SPF verifies the authenticity of an email sender's domain</p> <p>DKIM verifies the authenticity of an email message using digital signatures</p> <p>DMARC provides additional features for email authentication and reporting, and specifies how receivers should handle failed authentication attempts</p> <p>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) works with Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to authenticate mail senders to your recipient mail servers (the personnel you are sending emails to).</p> <p>These are three protection mechanisms that help maintain mail purity as it travels to your clients, but is not an automatic/universal measure in many cases across many service providers.</p> <p>DMARC ensures the destination email systems trust messages sent from your domain.

These addresses are used for different purposes. For example, look at these addresses:</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"Mail From\" address: This identifies the sender and says where to send return notices if any problems occur with the delivery of the message (such as non-delivery notices). The Mail From address appears in the envelope portion of an email message and isn't displayed by your email application, and is sometimes called the 5321.MailFrom address or the reverse-path address. You won't see it unless you examine the headers, but believe me, it's there.</p> </li> <li> <p>\"From\" address: This is the address displayed as the From address by your mail application. The From address identifies the author of the email. That is, the mailbox of the person or system responsible for writing the message. The From address is sometimes called the 5322.From address.</p> </li> </ul> <p>SPF uses a DNS TXT record to list the specific authorized sending IP addresses and services for a domain. Normally, SPF checks only get performed against the 5321.MailFrom address. The 5322.From address (remember, that's the second one) isn't authenticated when you use SPF by itself, which allows for a scenario where a user gets a message that passed SPF checks but has a spoofed 5322.From sender address. </p> <p>This is no fun for anybody, because it's a huge security hole in the phishing and spam realm.</p> <p>The 5321 and 5322 numbers are highly boring geek-speak referring to the Request For Comments (RFC) on these provided by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). If you'd like to tiptoe through the tulips of Internet pain, I leave them here for your reference:</p> <p>https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322</p> <p>Let me give you an example, and in this one the sender addresses are as follows:</p> <p>Mail from address (5321.MailFrom): badguy@phishing.nastyplace.com</p> <p>From address (5322.From): security@yourhappydomain.com</p> <p>If SPF is configured, then the receiving server does a check against the Mail from address badguy@phishing.nastyplace.com. If the message came from a valid source for the domain phishing.nastyplace.com, then the SPF check passes. By \"valid source\", that means that the originating server exists, not that it's actually yours. See the problem already in progress? Since the email client only displays the From address, the user sees this message came from security@yourhappydomain.com. With SPF alone, the validity of yourhappydomain.com was never authenticated.</p> <p>When we use DMARC, the receiving server will additionally perform a check against the From address. In the example above, if there's a DMARC TXT record in place for yourhappydomain.com, then the check against the From address fails because the \"Mail from\" is a mismatch against the legitimate domain.</p> <p>That deceptive email is bounced or quarantined, and the crisis you never knew you had is diverted.</p> <p>Once we've set up SPF and DMARC, we need to set up DKIM. </p> <p>DKIM lets you add a digital signature to email messages in the message header that certify the message in fact originated from your mail server and nowhere else. It's a security measure for your domain specifically, similar to a house or car key, except more cryptographic and messier looking. If you don't set up DKIM and instead allow the mail server to use their default DKIM configuration for your domain, DMARC may fail. This failure can happen because the default DKIM configuration will use the standard nexcess.net domain as the 5321.MailFrom address, not your specific domain. This creates a mismatch between the 5321.MailFrom and the 5322.From addresses in all the email sent from your domain.</p> <p>There are other hairs we could split here that include third-party services, but this is meant to provide an overview of these three records and why they must be intentionally and correctly implemented.</p> <p>If you need to verify or adjust these settings for your own domain or another, I recommend using the DMARCly tool (https://dmarcly.com/tools/), which makes it easy to generate and check your settings.

A recursive resolver (also known as a DNS recursor) is the first stop in a DNS query. The recursive resolver acts as a middleman between a client and a DNS nameserver.

During this process, the recursive resolver will cache information received from authoritative nameservers.

When two devices connect over the Internet, the ICMP generates errors to share with the sending device in the event that any of the data did not get to its intended destination. For example, if a packet of data is too large for a router, the router will drop the packet and send an ICMP message back to the original source for the data.</p> <p>A secondary use of ICMP protocol is to perform network diagnostics; the commonly used terminal utilities traceroute and ping both operate using ICMP. The traceroute utility is used to display the routing path between two Internet devices. The routing path is the actual physical path of connected routers that a request must pass through before it reaches its destination. The journey between one router and another is known as a \u2018hop,\u2019 and a traceroute also reports the time required for each hop along the way. This can be useful for determining sources of network delay.</p> <p>The ping utility is a simplified version of traceroute. A ping will test the speed of the connection between two devices and report exactly how long it takes a packet of data to reach its destination and come back to the sender\u2019s device. Although ping does not provide data about routing or hops, it is still a very useful metric for gauging the latency between two devices. The ICMP echo-request and echo-reply messages are commonly used for the purpose of performing a ping.</p> <p>Unfortunately network attacks can exploit this process, creating means of disruption such as the ICMP flood attack and the ping of death attack.</p>"},{"location":"icmp.html#how-does-icmp-work","title":"How does ICMP work?","text":"<p>Unlike the Internet Protocol (IP), ICMP is not associated with a transport layer protocol such as TCP or UDP.

Most common type is the UTP cable (unshielded twisted pair) which can transmit and receive data, as well as a central box (Hub/Switch) that handles a flow from one machine to another. Each system on a network has a cable connected to the central box.</p> <p>Network Interface Card (NIC) serves as the interface between the PC and the network. Each NIC has a unique identifier with a 48-bit value called media access control address (MAC address) so data is transferred to the right system. No two NICs ever share the same MAC address. Those numbers are provided by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to the companies making NICs, which often print the numbers onto the device itself using hexadecimal notation.  - Example: 00\u201340\u201305\u201360\u20137D\u201349</p> <p>First six digits in MAC address represent the number of the NIC manufacturer and they are referred to as Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) while the last six digits represent the unique serial number for the NIC and are referred to as device ID. Nomenclature for MAC addresses is also known as MAC-48 and EUI-48 (Extended Unique Identifier, chosen for trademarking purposes).\u00a0</p> <p>NICs transfer the information through the UTP cable in the form of binary data that is broken down into discrete chunks called frames. The NICs create and send, as well as receive and read these frames. Different frames are used on different networks and all NICs on the same network must use the same frame type to communicate with other NICs.</p> <p>(Optional)     Frame begins with the MAC address of the NIC to which the data is to be sent, followed by the MAC address of the sending NIC. Next comes the Types\u00a0field which indicates the type of data transferred, followed by the Data field which contains the encapsulated information. Lastly, there is a special bit of checking information called frame check sequence. FCS uses a type of binary math called cyclic redundancy check (CRC) in order to verify that the data has arrived intact. Most wired connections hold up to 1500 bytes of data.\u00a0</p> <p>When a system sends a frame out on the network, the frame goes into the central box. What happens from that point depends on the type of central box. - Hub could make a copy of the frame and send it to all the connected ports except for the port from which the message originated. Only the NIC to which the frame was addressed would process that frame and the others would drop it when they saw it wasn\u2019t addressed to their MAC addresses. - Switch sent a frame only to the interface associated with the destination of the MAC address.</p> <p>(Optional)     In situations where NIC doesn\u2019t know the MAC address of another NIC, they send a broadcast onto the network to ask for it. If a NIC sends a frame using a broadcast address (MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF), that frame is processed by every single NIC on that network. That broadcast frame\u2019s data will contain a request for a system\u2019s MAC address. Without knowing the MAC address to begin with, the requesting computer will use an IP address to pick the target computer out of the crowd. The system that is sought will read the request in the broadcast frame and respond its MAC address.</p> <p>When the frame finally arrives to the destination machine, the entire process will be reversed. - Data Link will remove the header and a trailer from the frame and pass the packet along to the Network layer. - Network layer will remove the header and pass the packet to the Transport layer. - Transport layer will read the destination port and transfer the frame to the appropriate service in the upper layers.</p> <p>PDU - protocol data unit</p>"},{"location":"internet-models.html#tcpip-model","title":"TCP/IP model","text":"<p>The reason why TCP/IP model has this name is because the persons who developed it focused primarily on these two protocols.

Length means the number of left-most contiguous mask bits that are set to one.</p> <p>So, network 172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0 can be represented as 172.16.0.0/16. CIDR also depicts a more hierarchical Internet architecture, where each domain takes its IP addresses from a higher level.</p> <p>This allows for the summarization of the domains to be done at the higher level. For example, if an ISP owns a network 172.16.0.0/16, then the ISP can offer 172.16.1.0/24, 172.16.2.0/24, and so on to customers.</p> <p>Yet, when advertising to other providers, the ISP only needs to advertise 172.16.0.0/16.
